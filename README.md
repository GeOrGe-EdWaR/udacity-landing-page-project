# landing page

in my project i used to select the sections 2 selectors **querySelectorAll()** and **getElementById()**

and i started to create the nabbar with function called **createNav()** the i looped on the sections with **forEach()** then i used **onclick** to add and remove the active classes on clicking the i
created Button with **span()** in HTML and i called it in my js file with **querySelector()** to get to the top of the page.
